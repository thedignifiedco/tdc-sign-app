# Adobe Sign API Demo App

This web app is built to demonstrate some capabilities of Adobe Sign REST API.

## Features

- **Send Agreement**: Create an agreement using either a transient document or a library document. If a Library Document ID is not defined, your most recent library document will be used to create a new agreement.
- **Get Agreements**: Fetch and display the status of the last 10 agreements.
- **Templates**: Retrieve and display a list of the last 10 templates.
- **Send Reminder**: Manually send reminders for agreements.
- **Download Agreements**: Download signed agreements.
- **Embedded Signing**: Get signing URL and host embedded/in-app signing.
